//! ZK proof backend seams, bound to a [`Circuit`].
//!
//! A [`Circuit`] is the type-level structure of a statement: it binds the
//! private *witness* to its *public inputs* (the claim) — the field
//! elements committed into the proof. The concrete proving artifacts — the
//! compiled circuit and the verifying key, plus its hash — live with the
//! backend in the zk crates (e.g. `outbe-zk-canonical`); a circuit type
//! here is the contract those backends and the protocol agree on.
//!
//! [`ProofGenerator`]/[`ProofVerifier`] are the backend seams,
//! parameterized by the circuit so a prover and a verifier for the *same*
//! `C` necessarily agree on the witness and public-input types.
